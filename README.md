Hi! This is a small project I coded for my senior capstone project involving effects of music on the brain.

memory game (with audio clips instead of images) using html + javascript + css

**All music & images used are taken from free stock websites, please contact if you are the owner of these files and would like me to remove them!


bugs (to be patched):

-glitch where sometimes the button is pressed and the sound doesn't play or when a match is made and only one button changes colour
